Last updated: June 1, 2025

Welcome to FA Media!

These Terms of Service govern your use of our website (famedia.co.in) and the services we offer. By using our site or hiring us, you agree to these terms.

1. Services
FA Media is a digital agency providing custom website development, branding, automation solutions, and deployment support. All services are tailored per client and scope agreed upon in writing.

2. Payments
All project payments must be made upfront or as per a defined milestone agreement. We accept payments via Stripe, bank transfer, or UPI. Work begins only after payment is received.

3. Project Timelines
Timelines are discussed at the start of each project. Delays caused by lack of client input or feedback may extend delivery dates. We aim for timely delivery with quality.

4. Revisions
We offer up to 1 round of revision per project. Additional changes may incur extra fees.

5. Refund Policy
Due to the custom and digital nature of our work, **we do not offer refunds** once development has started. If you cancel before project kickoff, a partial refund may be issued (minus consultation and processing fees). Dissatisfaction will be handled professionally â€” we aim to resolve all issues promptly.

6. Intellectual Property
Clients receive full ownership of their final website assets and code after full payment. FA Media retains the right to showcase the work in its portfolio unless the client requests otherwise.

7. Client Responsibilities
Clients are responsible for providing required content (text, images, branding) in a timely manner. Delayed inputs may delay project delivery.

8. Limitation of Liability
FA Media is not responsible for data loss, third-party plugin errors, hosting issues, or damages arising after project delivery.
